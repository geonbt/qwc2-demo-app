# Requirements

An working QGIS server environment is required. Projects which are to be offered as QWC2 topics must be published as WMS.

Furthermore, a web server is required which will serve the QWC2 application.

<!-- If possible, the QGIS server should run on the same scheme, hostname and port as the QWC2 application, otherwise additional measures need to be taken to allow cross-origin QWC2 requests see [Cross-Origin requests](#cross-origin-requests). -->
